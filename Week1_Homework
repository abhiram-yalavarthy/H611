# Week 2: Vectors and Matrices  

## Vector Operations  
### Dot Product  
The dot product of two vectors **u** and **v** is calculated as:  
**u · v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ)**  
- **θ** is the angle between the vectors.  
- **Example:**  
  Let **u = (2, 3)** and **v = (4, 1)**:  
u · v = 2(4) + 3(1) = 11


### Magnitude and Direction  
- **Magnitude:**  
||v|| = sqrt(x² + y²)


- **Direction:**  
θ = arctan(y / x)

## Trigonometric Definitions  
### Polar and Cartesian Coordinates  
- **From Cartesian to Polar:**  
r = sqrt(x² + y²) θ = arctan(y / x)


- **From Polar to Cartesian:**  
x = r cos(θ) y = r sin(θ)



## Solving Linear Equations  
### Geometric Interpretation  
Solving a system of linear equations means finding the intersection of their corresponding lines (in 2D) or planes (in 3D).  

### Matrix Example  
For **Ax = b**, where:  
A = [[2, 1], [1, -1]]

b = [[3], [0]]


Solve using elimination or substitution to find **x**.  

## Row Reduction  
### Example: Gaussian Elimination  
Given matrix:  
A = [[1, 2, -1], [2, -3, 4], [-1, 1, 3]]

Row reduce to reach row echelon form:  
[[ 1, 2, -1], [ 0, -7, 6], [ 0, 0, -2]]



## Linear Combinations  
A **linear combination** involves scaling and summing vectors:  
c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + ...


- **Example:**  
  Let **v₁ = (1, 0)** and **v₂ = (0, 1)**:  
3v₁ + 2v₂ = (3, 2)


## Linear (In)dependence and Span  
- **Linear Dependence:** Vectors are dependent if one can be written as a combination of others.  
- **Span:** The set of all vectors that can be formed as linear combinations of a given set.  

## Matrix Operations  
### Matrix-Vector Multiplication  
Matrix-vector multiplication applies a transformation.  

**Example:**  
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

v = [[5], [6]]


Result:  
A · v = [[1(5) + 2(6)], [3(5) + 4(6)]] = [[17], [39]]
